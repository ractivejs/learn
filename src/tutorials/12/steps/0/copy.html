<p>Normally, when an element is rendered, it just sort of gets plonked on the page. With Ractive you have more control: you can specify <code>intro</code> transitions:</p>

<pre class='prettypring lang-html'>
&lt;div intro='fade'&gt;This div will fade into view&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

<p>Try adding intros to the three buttons in the template, choosing from <code>fade</code>, <code>slide</code> and <code>fly</code>.</p>

<aside>
	<p>As with custom events, transitions are distributed as plugins, <a href='https://github.com/RactiveJS/Ractive/wiki/Plugins'>which you can download here</a> to use in your project. You can create your own transitions &ndash; <a href='https://github.com/RactiveJS/Ractive/wiki/Transitions'>see this wiki page</a> for more info.</p>

	<p>Caution! Some of the built-in transitions currently use CSS animations, which don't work in IE9 and below, and which don't look quite as slick in IE10 as in modern browsers. That's because IE is crap (yes, even IE10). Specifically, it can't animate certain styles (such as <code>left</code>) using CSS &ndash; the solution is to use good old interval-based animation rather than CSS transitions in these cases. Hopefully we'll be able to address this in future versions of <span class='logo'>Ractive.js</span>. In the meantime, friends don't let friends use IE.</p>
