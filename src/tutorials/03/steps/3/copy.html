<p>It's possible to define custom events in <span class='logo'>Ractive.js</span>. You use them just like normal events:</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-html'>
&lt;button on-tap='activate'&gt;Activate!&lt;/button&gt;
</pre>

<p>Note that we're using <code>on-tap</code> here instead of <code>on-click</code> &ndash; <code>tap</code> is a custom event.</p>

<div class='hint'>
	<p>Custom events are distributed as plugins, <a href='https://github.com/RactiveJS/Ractive/wiki/Plugins'>which can be downloaded from here</a> to include in your project.</p>

	<p>You can also create your own plugins &ndash; just <a href='https://github.com/RactiveJS/Ractive/wiki/Plugin-APIs'>follow the instructions on the wiki</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>The trouble with <code>click</code> is that it's nonsense. If you put your mouse down on the 'activate' button, waggle it about, then lift your finger up after a few seconds, the browser will in most cases consider it a 'click'. I don't. Do you?</p>

<p>Furthermore, if your interface needs to work on touch devices, using <code>click</code> means a 300ms delay between the <code>touchstart</code>-<code>touchend</code> sequence event and the simulated <code>mousedown</code>-<code>mouseup</code>-<code>click</code> sequence.</p>

<p>The <code>tap</code> event corrects for both of these anomalies. Try replacing the <code>click</code> proxies in the template.</p>
