<p>Ordinarily in a template, mustaches stand in for data. But occasionally you need to insert chunks of HTML into your view &ndash; for that, we have the triple-stache: <code>{{{content}}}</code>.</p>

<p>In fact, you're looking at the work of a triple-stache right now &ndash; this whole tutorial is one big Ractive, and the HTML for this explanatory text is represented by a triple.</p>

<p>Try running this code:</p>

<textarea class='interactive'>
ractive.set( 'content', '<a href="http://bit.ly/QOyWC1"><img src="/gifs/image.gif"/></a>' );
</textarea>

<aside>
	<p>That was a short tutorial! When using triples, bear in mind that when their data changes, the nodes they represent must be removed from the DOM before being re-rendered and reinserted. For that reason, you shouldn't use triples where regular mustaches will do the same job &ndash; <span class='logo'>Ractive.js</span> is able to operate more efficiently with mustaches.</p>
