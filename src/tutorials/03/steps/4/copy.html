<p>Because you're a thoughtful and responsible (and probably devastatingly good-looking) web developer, you're in the habit of using <em>event delegation</em> when you have lots of elements the user may interact with.</p>

<p>Just, in case, a quick recap. Event delegation is the technique of adding an event listener to a parent element (such as the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> in the example on the right) instead of each of its children (the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> elements), which tests to see if the <em>event target</em> (or any of the nodes between the target and the element to which the handler was attached, if the target isn't a child node thereof) matches a <em>delegate selector</em>.</p>

<p>This is good practice for two reasons. Firstly, it means you're not creating a ton of event handlers. Secondly, if children are added or removed, it causes us no extra work &ndash; we don't need to keep attaching new handlers.</p>

<p>But with <span class='logo'>Ractive.js</span> event delegation is no longer necessary. Only one event handler is created for each proxy event &ndash; that same handler gets reused with multiple elements. And due to the very nature of what we're doing, we don't need to worry about attaching event handlers to new elements &ndash; it's done for us automatically.</p>

<p>This is in fact <em>more</em> efficient than event delegation. Because here's event delegation's dirty little secret &ndash; it often means that many events get processed unnecessarily, and the process of testing child elements to see if they match a selector takes precious cycles, particularly with complex selectors and DOM trees.</p>
