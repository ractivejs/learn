<p>Animation can play an important role in communicating changing states of your webapp. In this tutorial we'll learn about using <code>ractive.animate()</code>.</p>

<p>Here, we've got a bar chart showing average temperatures throughout the year. We want there to be a smooth transition when the user changes the city using the dropdown menu.</p>

<p>Find the code that changes the data in the bar chart when the user makes a selection from the dropdown. Change <code>this.set</code> to <code>this.animate</code>...</p>

<p>...and that's it! We now have a smooth transition between cities &ndash; not just the bar height, but the labels and colours as well.</p>

<div class='hint'>
	<p><span class='logo'>Ractive.js</span> is efficient about how it handles animations. Even though there are a total of 72 properties being animated each time (height, colour and label text for two bars for each of twelve months), there is a single animation loop which uses <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> where possible, and which runs as long as there are one or more sets of animations in progress.</p>

	<p>If a second animation on a keypath were to start before the first had completed, the first would be cancelled.</p>
</div>
