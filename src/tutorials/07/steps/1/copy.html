<p>Time to create our <code>Slideshow</code> class:</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-js'>
var Slideshow = Ractive.extend({
  // this will be applied to all Slideshow instances
  template: template,

  // method for changing the currently displayed image
  goto: function ( imageNum ) {
    // goto method goes here...
  },

  // initialisation code
  oninit: function ( options ) {
    // initialisation code goes here...
  }
});
</pre>

<p>Each <code>Slideshow</code> instance will have a <code>goto</code> method in addition to the normal <code>Ractive</code> instance methods. Any set-up work we need to do can happen in the <code>oninit</code> handler, which gets called as soon as the template has been rendered.</p>

<p>Let's write our <code>goto</code> method:</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-js'>
function ( imageNum ) {
  var images = this.get( 'images' );

  // Make sure the image number is between 0...
  while ( imageNum < 0 ) {
    imageNum += images.length;
  }

  // ...and the maximum
  imageNum %= images.length;

  // Then, update the view
  this.set({
    image: images[ imageNum ],
    current: imageNum
  });
}
</pre>

<p>Next, we need to listen for the <code>goto</code> event, so that we can call <code>this.goto()</code>. We wire it up inside our <code>oninit</code> handler:</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-js'>
init: function ( options ) {
  this.on( 'goto', function ( event, index ) {
    this.goto( index );
  });

  // start with the first image
  this.goto( 0 );
}
</pre>

<p>The initial value of <code>current</code> is set to 0 at the end of the <code>init()</code> method. </p>
<p>Let's add some code to instantiate the slideshow with our gifs. There's a ready-made <code>images</code> variable you can use for this step:</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-js'>
var slideshow = new Slideshow({
  el: output,
  data: { images: images }
});
</pre>

<p>Go ahead and execute the code &ndash; you should now have a working slideshow.</p>

<aside>
  <p>Needless to say, you could add as many bells and whistles as you wanted &ndash; fading or sliding transitions, image preloading, thumbnails, touchscreen gesture controls, and so on.</p>

  <p>You could, of course, just use an existing image slideshow library. But then you would have to learn that library, and potentially submit to its design philosophy.</p>

  <p><span class='logo'>Ractive.js</span> is all about flexibility. If you want to change the design or behaviour of a component (say, adding a class name to a particular element), the power to do so is in your hands &ndash; the template is easy to understand and tweak because it's basically just HTML, and the view logic is straightforward.</p>

  <p>It's better to be able to build your own solution than to rely on developers maintaining high quality and up-to-date documentation.</p>
